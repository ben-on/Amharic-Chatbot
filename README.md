## Why This Project Was Created

Big chatbots like ChatGPT often struggle to provide accurate and context-aware responses in Amharic. While they excel in widely used languages, their performance in lesser-represented languages like Amharic is limited due to a lack of linguistic and cultural adaptation.  

The Amharic Chatbot aims to bridge this gap by delivering a high-quality conversational experience tailored specifically for Amharic speakers. By focusing on the nuances of the language and culture, this chatbot seeks to make conversational AI more inclusive and accessible.
